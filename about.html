      <!-- Using the revised, elaborated text -->
      <p>At Faerie, our core mission is to create a new generation of artificial intelligence that is both powerful and environmentally friendly. We are dedicated to creating AI solutions that maximize efficiency and conserve energy without compromising performance or speed. While traditional AI models often consume significant resources, some requiring up to 500 mL of water and 100 to 150 watts of power per conversation, EcoAI is committed to a different path. Through advanced optimization techniques and sustainable design, we strive to dramatically reduce the energy footprint of our technology, making responsible computing a reality. Our goal is to set a new industry standard where superior AI performance goes hand-in-hand with environmental stewardship.</p>
